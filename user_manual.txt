What's that?
============

It's an old rotary phone with most of the parts inside replaced by more modern electronics, which
can play audio files associated with a predefined phone number. Additional audio files can be
stored via the USB cable at the back. The phone runs on a LiPo battery, which is also charged with
the USB cable.


How do I use it?
================

The phone software is designed to mimic the behavior of a real phone, so it should be fairly
intuitive to use: pick it up, dial a number, listen, hang up. If you want more details on what to
expect, here it is:

1. Pick up the handset. This powers up the phone.
2. One second after picking up, you hear a dial tone.
2. Once the dial tone starts playing, you have thirty seconds to dial a number. If you don't dial
   anything, the phone goes straight to step 7.
3. Once you start dialing, the dial tone stops.
4. Every time you dial a new digit and the wheel stops turning, you have three seconds to dial the
   next digit. If no new digit is input within three seconds, or if eight digits have already been
   input, the phone tries to compose that number.
   Ex: Dial 0, then 3, then 0, and wait three seconds -> the phone tries to compose the number 030.
5. If the composed number corresponds to the name of an audio file stored on the phone, the file is
   played back. If this file doesn't exist, the phone goes straight to step 7.
6. Once the audio file is finished playing, there's two seconds of silence.
7. The busy tone plays for 30 seconds, after which it goes silent.

Additional notes:
- At any time, the sequence can be restarted by hanging up and picking up the handset again.
- Just because the phone is silent, doesn't mean that the electronics inside are off.
  The phone is powered all the time that the handset is off the hook, so if you don't want to drain
  the battery unnecessarily, be sure to put the handset back on the hook properly after use.
- Most of the behavior can be changed, for example waiting five seconds instead of three between
  digits. If you need a change or a new feature, please contact me.


How do I add new numbers/audio files?
=====================================

1. Prepare the audio files:
   a. The only file format that the current software can play is OGG.
   b. The memory on the phone is limited to 16 MB total, so keep the audio files small.
      The following characteristics seem to give a good compromise between file size and quality:
      mono, sampling frequency 22 kHz, 16-bit encoding. A 2:30 OGG file like this is about 1 MB.
      If you want to make it even smaller, try reducing the sampling to 8 kHz.
   c. Name the file with its phone number. For example, if you want a file to be available under the
      number 030, name your file "030.ogg" (without the quotation marks). Phone numbers must have at
      least one digit and at most eight digits. The file extension can be in lowercase or in
      uppercase (both "030.ogg" and "030.OGG" are acceptable).
2. Connect the phone's USB cable to your computer.
3. The phone should appear as a standard flash drive would. There should already be at least this
   user manual on the phone as well as two audio file, "dial.ogg" and "busy.ogg". Copy your audio
   files to the phone.
4. On your computer, click on "Remove USB device safely" (depending on your operating system).
5. Unplug the USB cable.
6. Try the new numbers by calling them.

If the phone is plugged into a computer, it can't be used to call a number. Conversely, if the phone
is unhooked and then plugged into a computer, the computer might not recognize it. It's only
guaranteed to work when doing one or the other: either you use it as a phone, or you use it as a USB
drive. But not at the same time.


How to charge the battery
=========================

The battery is charged by plugging the USB cable into any USB port (computer or charger).
I recommended charging the phone for a short time (half an hour to an hour) every day or every other
day. This will prolong the battery life, compared for instance to do a full long charge every week.

Here are some additional infos if you need:

- It's a 2000 mAh LiPo battery, which should hold for several days if people take care of hanging up
  properly after use.
- Full charge from 0% to 100% takes about 4-5 hours.
- There's a protection against overcharging and deep discharging, so you won't break anything by
  leaving the phone plugged in after it's already fully charged, but I still don't recommend it.
  It's good quality electronics and I took care of assembling everything safely, but lithium
  batteries are still know to catch fire and/or explode from time to time, so please don't leave
  the phone plugged and unattended for long periods of time.
- If you turn the phone upside down while it's plugged in, and look through the holes in the bottom
  plate, you will see a small green light and a small red light. The red light goes off when the
  battery is fully charged, so if you see only a green light, it means that charging is done.
  However, all this isn't too important -- just make sure to charge the phone a little bit every day
  or couple of days, and everything will be fine.


How do I care for the phone?
============================

Don't drop it, don't hit it, don't let it come in contact with liquids (including rain), don't
submit it to extreme temperatures (e.g. leaving it in the sun in summer, or outside in winter),
don't store it for long period of times without unplugging the battery, and don't pull too hard on
the cables.

Just treat it with love <3


Troubleshooting
===============

The phone doesn't seem to work at all: First make sure that the battery is charged.

The dial tone or the busy tone don't play according to the sequence described at the beginning of
this file: Plug the phone into a computer and check if both files "dial.ogg" and "busy.ogg" are
present. If they aren't, restore them (https://github.com/xdlg/robinhood.phone/tree/main/sounds).

Everything inside the phone is glued, screwed, or taped down. If you pick it up (the whole device,
not just the handset) and shake it a little bit, it shouldn't sound like something is moving
around. If that is the case, open the case by unscrewing the two screws on the bottom. Be careful
when lifting the top part, because the dial is cabled to the electronics inside. Try to find what
has come loose and if it's obvious, fix it. You can check out the pictures on the Hackaday page
(https://hackaday.io/project/178458-robinhoodphone) to see how the inside should look like.

Nothing happens when you plug the USB cable into your computer: Unplug it, make sure that the phone
is on the hook, then plug it in again. If you still have issues and you're using Microsoft Windows,
then try to stop using Microsoft Windows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The hook doesn't slide up or down: Open the case as explained above, and put some WD40 on the
hook's metal shaft (the little metal rod that is attached to the hook in the top part of the case).
